# Risk-Aware Estimation for Nitrification-BasedBio-filtration in Recirculating Aquaculture System
We implement a particle filter to estimate the concentrations of NH_x-N and NO_3-N sequentially in a recirculating aquaculture system. The resulting estimate and posterior distribution from the particle filter are used as part of a sequential risk-aware MMSE estimator for the same system. A performance comparison between the proposed estimators using metrics such as error variance, mean squared error and execution time per iteration
